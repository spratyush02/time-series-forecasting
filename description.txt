BCI: Business Confidence Index
This business confidence indicator provides information on future developments, 
based upon opinion surveys on developments in production, orders and stocks of finished 
oods in the industry sector. It can be used to monitor output growth and to anticipate turning 
points in economic activity. Numbers above 100 suggest an increased confidence in near future 
business performance, and numbers below 100 indicate pessimism towards future performance.

CCI: Consumer Confidence Index
This consumer confidence indicator provides an indication of future developments of households’ 
consumption and saving, based upon answers regarding their expected financial situation, their sentiment 
about the general economic situation, unemployment and capability of savings. 
An indicator above 100 signals a boost in the consumers’ confidence towards the future economic situation, 
as a consequence of which they are less prone to save, and more inclined to spend money on 
major purchases in the next 12 months. Values below 100 indicate a pessimistic attitude towards 
future developments in the economy, possibly resulting in a tendency to save more and consume less.

CLI: Composite Leading Indicator
The composite leading indicator (CLI) is designed to provide early signals of turning points in business cycles showing
 fluctuation of the economic activity around its long term potential level. CLIs show short-term 
economic movements in qualitative rather than quantitative terms
