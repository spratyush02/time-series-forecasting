# Data Science pipeline for prediction of Coal Prices.

Highlights:
    Extensive EDA
    Feature Selection and Extraction
    ARIMA Model Trained
    XGBRegressor (ML) trained
    LSTM (DL) trained
    Hyperparameter tuning using TALOS


We have two notebooks:

1) project.ipynb -  For ARIMA and LSTM model
2) ML.ipynb - for Machine Learning model


Thank you
